run the cbd50gigdiskup script to install it.


you need go and jq and git and a few other things installed.

if all goes well it will install a systemd service to bring up
and clealy take down a 50 gig compressed block device in /opt/cbd

it assumes you make a partition on the block device such that partprobe
creates a /dev/cbd50gigdisk1 device.
